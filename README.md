# FormMakerApplication

This is one of my portfolio projects where I utilize full stack technologies to make a fully fledged web application from scratch.
I also tried to minimize the amount of libraries I use in this project as much as possible.
The main purpose of this project is to apply the React.js, SCSS and TypeScript fundamentals I learned, and apply them in a real-world application.

Technologies used:
- React.js
- SCSS
- TypeScript
